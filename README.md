<p> I would like to thank my faculty Shaikh Shawon Arefin Shimon Sir.</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>In Bangladesh, especially in Dhaka City, there are so many people (other than the PROs) who love to play chess regularly, or every now and then. So many of them are so passionate about this game that they even want to buy stuff and accessories that are all about chess. Chess books, chess clocks, chess bags, chess T-shirts, for example, and, of course, along with different kinds and designs of chess boards and pieces of chess. The main objective was to create a platform for eCommerce where chess freaks can order and purchase their desired products online from anywhere in our country.</p>
<p> Chess Station is an eCommerce website built with latest technologies.</p>

On the other hand, for <em>Backend</em>, used <strong>Laravel Framework</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> for the database.</p>
